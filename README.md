Demonstrate the process of Huffman Coding using a Greedy Strategy. Accept input from the user in the
form of characters and their corresponding frequencies, and construct a tree that illustrates the Human
codes for each character. Additionally, provide an analysis of the time and space complexities for the
best case, worst case, and average case scenarios
